This platform allows users to post a specific request for any problems or faults in their electronic devices. The request will also specify whether the user wants the repairman to come to their home for repair or they would want to go to the repairman. This request will go the service provider portal where repairmen can sign up to offer their repairing services. Service providers will bid on repair requests. One of the bids will be accepted by the user. Repairmen will complete the ticket. Then the user can leave a review and rating. Review and rating will contribute to a service providerâ€™s all time statistics. The platform will also contain a dispute center for any complications during ticket fulfillments.
